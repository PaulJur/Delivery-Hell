# Delivery-Hell

--Uni work--

A Top-Down 2D puzzle type game which was made as a request from the company on my internship where you have to deliver boxes in a certain time
beating all sorts of puzzles from moving conveyor belts with fake boxes to mazes to deadly saw traps which made the games difficulty spike by a good margin each level (there are 3).

Game was made using Unity Game Engine and coded in C#. Majority of assets were from the Unity store.
