Level 3 having a big difficulity spike including saw and spike traps that force you to respawn and do it again. As a tip, grab the boxes when you get them at the end and just walk into the trap to respawn with the box so you don't have to do it all over again.

Game was made using Unity Game Engine and coded in C#. Majority of assets were from the Unity store.
